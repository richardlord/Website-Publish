<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I have never had a career plan or goal. I have developed my career by grabbing interesting opportunities when they pass nearby, and right now, that means writing. I began writing in 2018 when I wanted a break from game development, and I enjoyed it. I dabbled with screenwriting until, in 2022, I was accepted on and completed the Faber Academy Writing A Novel course. Now, I am writing short stories and my first novel. I will still do contract work as a game developer when the right jobs come along, but otherwise I am writing, writing, and writing some more.</p>

<p>In the past, I have choreographed and performed in contemporary dance productions in the UK and Europe, I have created installations in museums and galleries, I have designed and built games on Playstation, Xbox, PC, and mobile phones, and I have led a tech project at the United Nations. It has been interesting, and I wouldn’t change any of it.</p>

<p>If you want to know the meandering path that led me here, read on.</p>

<h2>How it all began</h2>

<p>I first touched a computer when I was twelve years old. This was in 1978, and the computer was a Commodore Pet that was the work computer of a friend of my parents. A couple of years later, I borrowed a Sinclair ZX80 from a friend, and a couple of years after that, I persuaded my parents to buy a BBC Micro, which I learned to program in Basic, Pascal, BCPL, and Assembler. I loved tinkering with it and playing games on it equally.</p>

<p>When I left school, I went to study mathematics at Cambridge University. I didn’t especially want to study maths, but I wanted to go to university and maths is something I'm good at. At university, I started dancing. A lot. It turns out I’m good at that too.</p>

<h2>Dance</h2>

<p>When I arrived to begin my first year at Cambridge, almost the first thing I did was join the university dance club. This was a spontaneous act that led to me spending much of my time in Cambridge dancing - first ballroom, then jazz, classical ballet, and contemporary dance. I enjoyed them all, but contemporary dance was my love and after completing my maths degree, I applied to dance schools.</p>

<p>What followed was another three years of study, this time at London Contemporary Dance School where I studied contemporary dance and choreography. While there, I fell in love again, this time with choreography, and I spent as much time as possible creating my own dances under the watchful eye of some outstanding teachers.</p>

<p>After graduating, I formed my own dance company, Big Room Dance Company, and struck out on my own as a choreographer. Over the following years, I created <a href="/dance/">contemporary dance productions</a> for my company and choreographed a few operas and musicals too.</p>

<h2>Video</h2>

<p>Choreography rarely earns enough money to pay the bills on its own, so when I left dance school I also seized an opportunity to work part-time making video recordings of live dance performances. I started as a camera operator but moved up to directing and mixing multi-camera shoots and editing promotional videos for dance companies. It was enjoyable work, and I met and worked with many great choreographers.</p>

<p>The video work led, via one of the production companies I was working with, into the developing world of interactive CD-ROMs where my previous experience in programming was useful. Soon I was supplementing my dance income through contracts as a programmer for educational games and installations, including projects with the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the Science Museum in London.</p>

<h2>Dance and Technology</h2>

<p>These many strands came crashing together when I was asked to experiment with a real-time motion capture rig. Unlike today’s motion capture equipment, this kit used magnetic fields to track motion and produced results in real time, which meant we could create a live performance using motion capture. I brought together a group of collaborators and we created <a href="/cyberkinesis/"><i>Cyberkinesis</i></a>, an installation where a dancer in the motion capture rig danced, and we interpreted her movement through an AI system that I wrote to an alien creature who danced with her. It was an exciting project and led to my involvement in many other projects overlapping dance and technology.</p>

<p>I created my <a href="/duets-for-small-spaces/">last dance theatre production</a> in 2001 and my last dance and technology production, <a href="/waterfall/">a dance game for PC</a>, in 2002. That was when I moved into the console games industry.</p>

<h2>Games</h2>

<p>I took time out to refine my skills and fell into a job working on the Burnout racing games at <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/criterion-games">Criterion Games</a>. I started as an engineer and after a couple of months they promoted me to lead engineer. I left Criterion in late 2005 after the development of Burnout Revenge and set out on my own again, this time developing web games for various clients. I would help to develop the game ideas and then write all the front-end and back-end code for the games.</p>

<p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.sticksports.com">Stick Sports</a> asked me to become their chief technology officer, another opportunity that I didn’t ask for but grabbed when it appeared. Stick Sports had some very successful web games and was looking to move into the mobile games space. During my three and a half years there, we successfully developed their existing cricket franchise into a series of popular mobile games and created a whole new and even more successful series of tennis games on mobile.</p>

<h2>On my own again</h2>

<p>I enjoyed working with the team at Stick Sports but by the end of 2014 I was itching to do more of my own work, so in January 2015 I left and set up on my own yet again to develop my own games and to provide consulting and development work to other game developers.</p>

<p>I released my first game, Freak Factory, in mid-2015.</p>

<p>Then I fell into multiple contracts prototyping new game ideas for <a href="https://www.king.com/">King</a>. Between 2016 and 2018, I prototyped three new game ideas with them, including a new Call of Duty mobile game. This prototyping work was again an opportunity that I wasn’t looking for, but it fit my range of experience and abilities. In game development terms, I could be called a generalist, but I have deep knowledge in many areas, I communicate well, and can work successfully with most individuals and teams. We developed successful prototypes with a team of two, just me and a game designer. This meant for King that they could develop an idea without pulling developers off existing projects.</p>

<h2>Screenwriting</h2>

<p>They say everyone has a story in them. Mine wanted to get out, so at the end of 2018, I took a break from game development to write it. I wrote it as a film script because it involved dancing, and I didn’t know how to make that work in a novel.</p>

<p>I attended short courses and read books on screenwriting, covered my wall in post-it notes, joined a screenwriters’ group, and wrote three drafts. The script was not great, but it achieved two important steps — I got that story out of my head, and I discovered I enjoy writing.</p>

<p>What followed was more courses, more reading, and more drafts of more stories. I learned many correct ways to structure a film, plan a character, and write a screenplay before realising I had to figure out what works for me.</p>

<h2>Novel Writing</h2>

<p>In mid-2021, with multiple drafts of three film scripts and one TV pilot in my pocket, screenwriter Richard Kurti recommended I read James Wood’s book <i>How Fiction Works</i>. I discovered that all those lectures and books on screenwriting had taught me everything about structure and nothing about how to use words and sentences to tell a story.</p>

<p>I wrote a short story, and I wallowed in the freedom to express myself on the page and to take complete control of how the story is told. Words are hard, but also fun and engaging. I enjoy finding the right combination to place a thought inside a reader’s head. The rules around screenwriting were a corset, and by throwing them off, I can dance once more.</p>

<p>I studied novel writing, through books and the Masterclass website, and wrote another short story before approaching my first novel. But writing can be a lonely pursuit. Isolated by Covid rules and longing to spend time with other writers, I applied to <a href="https://faberacademy.com">Faber Academy</a> for their renowned <i>Writing A Novel</i> course and was accepted in early 2022. The course was brilliant, and guided by the wonderful Shelley Weiner our gang of fifteen writers grew into a supportive and knowledgeable writing group.</p>

<p>We completed the course in July 2022, and I am now deep into writing my first novel.</p>
