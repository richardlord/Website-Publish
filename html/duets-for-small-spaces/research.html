<h1>Research</h1>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>The initial inspiration for this project came from the poetry of Vikram Seth. Reading his poems I was captivated by the simple, direct elegance and accessibility of the language. I wondered if it would be possible to develop a similar approach in dance. So I set out to create a work which is direct, simple, elegant and accessible. A work about human emotions and human relationships.</p>

<p>Since initiating the project, most of the specific ideas for themes have originated in my own experiences, either directly experienced or observed in those arouond me.</p>

<p>Specific sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘All you who sleep tonight’ by Vikram Seth</li>
<li>‘The Golden Gate’ by Vikram Seth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dance Research</h2>

<p>We did a two week residency in August 1999 at Chats Palace in Hackney, London, to research and develop the ideas for this project. In two weeks we developed a strong trust between us, an excellent collaborative working relationship, 30 minutes of dance, and the best creative team I’ve been involved in. All in all it was a greater success than I imagined it might be. Some of the material created at that time will be used in the final production.</p>

<p>The presentation after the research and development period was very well received by all the audience - experienced choreographers, regular dance attendees, other artists and residents of Hackney alike. We had a lot of positive feedback including letters from Hackney residents who were enthused by the performance.</p>
