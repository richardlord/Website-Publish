<h1>Resum&eacute;</h1>

<p><i>&#8220;I love this man! Richard created our first prototype: in the morning he arrived at the King offices and we had nothing but documentation, in the evening we had our very first playable. Richard is an amazing listener and a smart developer - he will build it to spec if you want, but his broad experience allows him to also think with you and offer alternative solutions. Richard is simply awesome. Fact.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Jesse America, Executive Producer, King</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;Richard is simply a legend. Not only is he an insanely fast and skillful coder, he is also design-minded, solving problems smartly and independently. While working on our prototype here at King, he was an invaluable asset both in terms of raw production and interpersonal skills, bringing his expertise and calm consideration to a fast-moving project. On top of that he is a really nice chap and all around great human being. He will be sorely missed and I cannot recommend Richard highly enough.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Florian Ziegler, Studio Design Lead, King</i></p>

<p><i>&#8220;Richard joined the nascent Longbow Studio as a contractor for over 3 months. Over that time he was the only developer in the team. His understanding of games, his experience in game development, his ability to write and modify code really fast were incredible assets that allowed the team to move to a pace that would have been impossible otherwise. I would have gladly hired Richard for a full time position, was he interested in one, and I highly recommend him.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Pietro Guardascione, Head of Studio, King</i></p>
