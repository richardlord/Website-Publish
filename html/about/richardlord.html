<h1>Richard Lord</h1>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p> I am a game developer with experience in a wide range of programming environments. I have been working on-and-off in the games industry since 1994, creating AAA console games, casual and mid-core mobile games, educational games, and museum installations.</p>

<p> I currently divide my time between developing my own games and providing consulting and development services for other games companies through full-time or part-time contracts.</p>

<p> I began programming at an early age and later studied it as part of my Mathematics degree at Cambridge University. My recent programming experience encompasses C#, Objective-C, Java, Actionscript, C++, PHP, Javascript and SQL.</p>

<p>I speak about technology and development on this blog and at conferences around the world. I am the developer of <a href="/ash/">Ash</a>, an open-source entity-component-system framework system for game developers.</p>
