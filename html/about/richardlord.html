<h1>Richard Lord</h1>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>I am a game developer and a choreographer with a wide range and depth of experience from a diverse variety of projects. I have been working on-and-off in the games industry since 1994, creating AAA console games, casual and mid-core mobile games, educational games, and museum installations, while also working as a choreographer and a video director, and now I've started writing screenplays too.</p>

<p>I divide my time between developing my own projects - games, dances and screenplays - and providing consulting and development services for games companies through full-time or part-time contracts. My recent consulting work has been prototyping. I have prototyped two games for <a href="https://king.com/">King</a>, including a new Call of Duty mobile game, and am soon to start prototyping a third game there. I have prototyped other games with indie developers, creating a minimal product that they can use to raise funding for their game ideas.</p>

<p>In game development terms I might be called a generalist but I have depth of knowledge in many areas and I am very good at rapid prototyping. I communicate well and can work well with most individuals and teams. A successful prototype can be developed by me, the game designer, and an artist alone, which means for larger companies an idea can be developed without having to pull people off existing projects and disrupting existing workflows.</p>

<p>I have worked with multiple tools over the years and my primary tool today is Unity.</p>

<h2>Career History</h2>

<p><b>2015-Present: Developing my own projects</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I left Stick Sports in January 2015 to develop my own projects.</li>
<li>I created and released <a href="/freak-factory/">Freak Factory</a>, developed in Unity. It is a game with a unique core mechanic, designed for children but with universal appeal. It is available on iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</li>
<li>I'm creating my second game, called <a href="/intergalactic-delivery-driver/">Intergalactic Delivery Driver</a>, also developed in Unity. It is a game about the gig economy where the player delivers parcels around the universe, flying spaceships though busy junctions, asteroid storms and wars, and trying to stay out of trouble, mostly.</li>
<li>I have written the first draft of a new feature-length screenplay.</li>
<li>I presented a session at the Develop conference in Brighton called &#8220;Lessons I learnt was a choreographer and apply as a game designer&#8221;.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>2015-Present: Freelance consultant and engineer for game development</b></p>
<ul>
<li>January 2018:<br />
Prototyping a new mobile game with an independent game designer. We created a prototype that the designer is using to gain funding for the project.</li>

I prototyped a new Call of Duty mobile game at <a href="https://king.com/">King</a> in Stockholm.

I left when the prototype was completed and the company recruited a permanent team to take the game forward.
<ul>
	<li><i>&#8220;I love this man! Richard created our first prototype: in the morning he arrived at the King offices and we had nothing but documentation, in the evening we had our very first playable. Richard is an amazing listener and a smart developer - he will build it to spec if you want, but his broad experience allows him to also think with you and offer alternative solutions. Richard is simply awesome. Fact.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Jesse America, Executive Producer, King</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>December 2015 - March 2016:<br />
I prototyped a new mid-core mobile game at <a href="https://king.com/">King</a> in London. I was the sole engineer and an integral part of the small team developing a new mobile game concept. I left when the prototype was completed and the company recruited a permanent team to take the game forward.
	<ul>
	<li><i>&#8220;Richard is simply a legend. Not only is he an insanely fast and skillful coder, he is also design-minded, solving problems smartly and independently&#8230;He will be sorely missed and I cannot recommend Richard highly enough.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Florian Ziegler, Studio Design Lead, King</i></li>
	<li><i>&#8220;[Richard&#8217;s] ability to write and modify code really fast were incredible assets that allowed the team to move to a pace that would have been impossible otherwise.&#8221;<br />&#8211; Pietro Guardascione, Head of Studio, King</i></li>
