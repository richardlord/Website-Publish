<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-10-17T12:00:00Z">17 October 2011</time></div>

<p>There was a critical bug in version 4.0.0 so here's a quick update to fix that bug. <a href="version-4-0-1-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<h2><a href="version-4-0-0-released.html">Version 4.0.0 of Flint released</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-10-16T12:00:00Z">16 October 2011</time></div>

<p>Earlier this week I released version 4.0.0 of Flint. This release is to support the new crop of 3d engines that are using Stage3d for rendering. As part of this it was necessary to alter a couple of APIs, hence the major release number incrementing to 4. The core architecture of Flint remains unchanged. <a href="version-4-0-0-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<h2><a href="flint-and-molehill.html">Flint and Molehill</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-07-28T12:00:00Z">28 July 2011</time></div>

<p>We've been doing a lot of work recently on adding molehill (aka Flash 11) support to Flint. Rather than integrate molehill support directly into Flint, I decided that the best way, at least for now, to bring the power of molehill to Flint is to integrate with the 3D rendering libraries that are themselves integrating with molehill. So we've been adding support for the molehill compatible versions of Away3D, Flare3D and Alternativa3D. <a href="flint-and-molehill.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-02-27T12:00:00Z">27 February 2011</time></div>

<p>Today I released version 3.0.1 of Flint. This is a minor bugfix release. There are no API changes so it should be fine for all users of version 3.0.0 to update immediately. <a href="version-3-0-1-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-01-20T12:00:00Z">20 January 2011</time></div>

<p>Today I released version 3.0.0 of Flint. The core architecture of Flint remains unchanged but a number of details have changed. In particular many APIs have changed, which is why the major version number has changed. The driver for this change was switching the 3D libraries to use Flash's native 3D geometry classes and the consequential dropping of support for Flash Player 9. <a href="version-3-0-0-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2010-12-24T12:00:00Z">24 December 2010</time></div>

<p>A couple of months ago I started work on a version of Flint that used Flash’s native Vector3D and Matrix3D classes. That Flint has it’s own 3D geometry classes causes confusion for a number of users and since Flash10 is now pretty-much ubiquitous it’s about time for Flint to make the switch over to these native classes. <a href="version-3-0-0-beta.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>Today I released version 2.2.1 of Flint. This includes changes to support version 3.6 of Away3D. If you are using an earlier version of Away3D you should stick with version 2.2.0 of Flint. <a href="version-2-2-1-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I've moved the development of Flint from GoogleCode to GitHub.

<p>A number of Flint users have written on-line tutorials recently and I've added those I'm aware of to the documentation page. There's now many more ways to learn about how to use Flint, particularly at the beginner level. If there's more tutorials out there that I've missed, let me know via the forum. <a href="many-additions-to-the-documentation.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2009-02-03T12:00:00Z">03 February 2009</time></div>

<p>For the 2.0.1 release I created a single Ant build script to build the swc library, the asdocs, and all the examples. This makes new releases a lot easier and should result in more frequent point updates for bug fixes.

<p>I checked in a number of minor changes today. These are mostly minor performance improvements which collectively will add up to a significant improvement for some effects.

<p>I updated the examples with code for version 2 of Flint. I added a few more examples at the same time. I really believe version 2 is now better and just as stable as version 1 for 2D development. 3D is also very stable - I just need to finalise a few features before going to beta. <a href="updated-examples.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>Today I released a new alpha of version 2 of the Flint particle system.

<p>I added a pixel renderer for papaervision this afternoon. It uses Papervision's effects layer with a Pixels object. In doing so, I found a bug in Papervision. The code doesn't work without the bug fix, in as much as removing one particle removes all particles unless you fix the bug in your copy of Papervision. The bug report and fix are here. <a href="papervision-pixel-renderer.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I added some improvements to the papervision3D rendering to the SVN repository this morning. Rotation now works on DisplayObject3D particles, the materials are managed in a similar way to the Away3D material management, and various other changes too. I'll update the docs and get an Alpha 2 out soon. <a href="improved-papervision3d-rendering.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2008-09-08T12:00:00Z">08 September 2008</time></div>

<p>Today I added to the Away3D renderer implementation. It will now render particles using an Away3D Object3D or a Flash DisplayObject. In the later case, an Away3D Billboard is used, in the form of a MovieClipSprite. I also started work on Papervision3D renderers, with two basic renderers. One uses Papervision's DisplayObject3D type for the particles, and the other uses Papervision's Particle type. <a href="more-away3d-and-papervision3d-renderer-development.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I was planning to spend a significant amount of time on Away3D and Papervision3D renderers this week, but unfortunately work got in the way of that. I have, however, just uploaded a simple Away3D renderer and a very basic example to test it. I only had an hour to work on this so it's very crude at the moment. I'll hopefully get some more time next week to work on it and other renderers. <a href="away3d-started.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I've decided to make this blog more like a developer diary than an announcements page - the blog had become a double to the announcements category in the forum. Also, by making this a developer diary I can keep you all updated on progress with new features and what has been checked into the code repository.

<p>Today, I added some key features for improving the physics in Flint. Primary among these is the addition of mass and radius properties to the particle class. The mass property represents the mass of the particle. By default, particles have a mass of 1. <a href="more-physics.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>In brief gaps between work I'm making steady progress on 2.0. It's pretty stable and working well. 2D is probably nearly as stable as 1.0.4, and has some new features that improve on the 1.0.4 version. 3D is working well with Flint's own renderers. <a href="version-20-alpha.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I haven't done much work on Flint since April. That's now changing since the large job I was working on is complete and I have some time to myself again. I thought I'd outline the plans for the next major version of Flint.

<p>I've been working on a number of big projects for a client - working in-house planning and architecting the projects, writing code, and managing their Actionscript developers - which has meant I haven't had much time over the last few months to work on the Flint particle system or any other of my own projects, to do research, or even to post very much on this blog. <a href="after-a-couple-of-days-relaxing.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I've added the alpha of the next version of Flint to the SVN code repository. This version will support 3D particle systems in addition to 2D particle systems as supported by the current version.

<p>I reorganised the SVN repository today. You may need to check-out the code all over again - sorry about that. It's a minor change but the repository's structure is more logical this way.
