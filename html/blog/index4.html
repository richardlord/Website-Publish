<h2><a href="/blog/ecs/introducing-ash.html">Ash - a new entity system framework for Actionscript games</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2012-01-11T12:00:00Z">11 January 2012</time></div>

<p>I've been doing a lot of stuff with entity systems recently. At try{harder} I gave a presentation about entity systems, which was warmly received and led to many interesting conversations. I also created example projects with the Ember and Xember frameworks and had fruitful conversations with Tom and Alec about their projects, even contributing a few minor bits of code to them.

But now I've written an entity system framework of my own. It's called Ash and you can find it on Github. <a href="/blog/ecs/introducing-ash.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/flash/so-what-are-adobe-up-to-with-flash.html">So what are Adobe up to with Flash?</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-11-14T12:00:00Z">14 November 2011</time></div>

<p>It has been an interesting week in the Flash world. Various announcements and clarifications about the future of Flash, which seem to add up to


Adobe will stop development of the Flash mobile browser plug-in, but mobile operating system and hardware developers are free to continue developing on top of Adobe's existing source code if they wish to license it from Adobe.
The Flex framework will be freed from Adobe's control, and will become more open under the guidance of an as yet undecided open source foundation which will include Adobe contributors and the Spoon project.
Development of the Flash plug-in for desktop browsers continues as normal.
Development of Adobe Air, including publishing for mobile apps, continues as normal.
There's renewed emphasis on the Flash platform as a platform for game development.
There has been some movement of jobs on the Flash CS Professional team, but the team still exists and the next version of the product is in development.


There's been a lot of hand-wringing as Flash developers struggle to figure out what this means for them. I don't propose to resolve that here - what this means for you depends on both your skill-set and your job. But I guess if I had one bit of advice it would be, if Actionscript is the only development language you know it's well past time for you to diversify your skills. Learning a second programming language makes you a better programmer in general, and learning a third, fourth, etc becomes easier with each language. I have lost track of the number of programming languages I have learnt, but each one has made me a better programmer.

What follows is merely my personal take on the situation. Make of it what you will. I'll start with an important question. <a href="/blog/flash/so-what-are-adobe-up-to-with-flash.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/actionscript/linked-list-performance-test.html">Four ways to link a list (a performance test on linked list architectures)</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-10-25T12:00:00Z">25 October 2011</time></div>

<p>In looking at entity systems for Flash games, and particularly the projects Ember and Xember, I was wondering what is the most efficient architecture for the linked lists used by these systems. So I ran some tests.

The code for these tests is all available on Github.

The lists in these frameworks are used to manage the component sets for the systems that run the game. These lists need to provide three functions - add an item, remove an item, and loop through all the items, and they need to do this as efficiently as possible.

So I created four different architectures for linked lists and ran a few performance tests. <a href="/blog/actionscript/linked-list-performance-test.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-10-16T12:00:00Z">16 October 2011</time></div>

<p>Earlier this week I released version 4.0.0 of Flint. This release is to support the new crop of 3d engines that are using Stage3d for rendering. As part of this it was necessary to alter a couple of APIs, hence the major release number incrementing to 4. The core architecture of Flint remains unchanged. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-4-0-0-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-07-28T12:00:00Z">28 July 2011</time></div>

<p>We've been doing a lot of work recently on adding molehill (aka Flash 11) support to Flint. Rather than integrate molehill support directly into Flint, I decided that the best way, at least for now, to bring the power of molehill to Flint is to integrate with the 3D rendering libraries that are themselves integrating with molehill. So we've been adding support for the molehill compatible versions of Away3D, Flare3D and Alternativa3D. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/flint-and-molehill.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
