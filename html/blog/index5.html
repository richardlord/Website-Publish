<h2><a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-1-released.html">Version 3.0.1 of Flint released</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-02-27T12:00:00Z">27 February 2011</time></div>

<p>Today I released version 3.0.1 of Flint. This is a minor bugfix release. There are no API changes so it should be fine for all users of version 3.0.0 to update immediately. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-1-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-02-26T12:00:00Z">26 February 2011</time></div>

<p>TCoral is covered by a set of performance tests for measuring and optimizing it's performance. These tests are run using Grant Skinner's performance test suite. I adapted these tests to also apply to the native 3D geometry classes, for comparison. This article is about the results of those tests. <a href="/blog/coral/performance-of-coral-vs-vector3d-and-matrix3d.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-02-25T12:00:00Z">25 February 2011</time></div>

<p>In this post I look at the key architectural differences between Coral and the native Vector3D and Matrix3D classes. Code architecture is an important area to me. I find well architected code is much easier to use, leading to more rapid development and fewer bugs. So good architecture in core classes like Vector3D and Matrix3D can make a lot of difference to developers. <a href="/blog/coral/architecture-of-coral-vs-vector3d-and-matrix3d.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>I started work on Flint Particles before Flash 10 was launched, so back then I created my own 3D mathematics classes for Flint. Recently I set about converting Flint to use the new native 3D classes that are in Flash 10. After making this change I was surprised to find two significant issues with the new code. The first was a couple of bugs in the native classes, which were not too serious since I could find a way to work around them. The second, and far more troubling issue, was a very large drop in performance - the code using the native 3D classes ran at about one quarter of the rate of the code using Flint's own 3D classes. <a href="/blog/coral/introducing-coral-an-actionscript-library-for-3d-math.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-0-released.html">Version 3.0.0 of Flint released</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-01-20T12:00:00Z">20 January 2011</time></div>

<p>Today I released version 3.0.0 of Flint. The core architecture of Flint remains unchanged but a number of details have changed. In particular many APIs have changed, which is why the major version number has changed. The driver for this change was switching the 3D libraries to use Flash's native 3D geometry classes and the consequential dropping of support for Flash Player 9. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-0-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-0-beta.html">Version 3.0.0 beta of Flint</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2010-12-24T12:00:00Z">24 December 2010</time></div>

<p>A couple of months ago I started work on a version of Flint that used Flash’s native Vector3D and Matrix3D classes. That Flint has it’s own 3D geometry classes causes confusion for a number of users and since Flash10 is now pretty-much ubiquitous it’s about time for Flint to make the switch over to these native classes. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-3-0-0-beta.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>Today I released version 2.2.1 of Flint. This includes changes to support version 3.6 of Away3D. If you are using an earlier version of Away3D you should stick with version 2.2.0 of Flint. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/version-2-2-1-released.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2010-10-21T12:00:00Z">21 October 2010</time></div>

<p>Once upon a time, choosing a framework for your Flash or Flex project was easy. You either used Cairngorm or you didn't. Then along came PureMVC, followed by Mate, Parsley, Robotlegs, Swiz, Sping Actionscript and many more. Getting to know all these frameworks takes a long time. Making a choice of which to use may take even longer. <a href="/blog/presentations/so-many-frameworks-so-little-time.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
