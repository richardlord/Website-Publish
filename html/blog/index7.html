<p>During my recent presentation at LFPUG, Tink was very persistent in suggesting that the event bus used in most MVC frameworks might not be the best solution. This got me thinking about what it would be like to do MVC without an event bus. And so began this little experiment. <a href="/blog/flex-mvc/flexcaster-smartysignals.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/flex-mvc/flexcaster-robotlegs.html">Robotlegs example project with source</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2009-11-17T12:00:00Z">17 November 2009</time></div>

<p>Any comparison of frameworks wouldn't be complete without Robotlegs. I included Robotlegs in my session at LFPUG recently, but didn't post the example project here because the framework was in a state of flux. Robotlegs is now settling down as it approaches its imminent 1.0 release, and the MVCS implementation in it is unlikely to change further, so here's my example.

For this Robotlegs example I've used exactly the same project as in the previous examples for other frameworks. Robotlegs is not prescriptive about your application's architecture, but it does include a default MVCS implementation for those that wish to use it. I've used that default implementation here.

The example is below. Links to the other versions follow. All versions have identical functionality. Right click on the swf to view the source. <a href="/blog/flex-mvc/flexcaster-robotlegs.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2009-10-27T12:00:00Z">27 October 2009</time></div>

<p>I recently posted a number of versions of the same Flex project, built using various different frameworks. These related to my presentation at Flash on the Beach this year. I'm repeating that presentation, with variations, at the London Flash Platform User Group in a few days and for that talk I'll be adding Parsley to the set of frameworks I'll compare.

As a warm-up to that I've recreated the same example as before using the Parsley framework. The example is below. Links to the other versions follow. All versions have identical functionality.

<p>At Flash on the Beach this year, I presented a session on application frameworks. As part of that session, I had planned to show the source for an example application built using each of the four frameworks I covered. When I discovered that as planned my presentation would take three hours to present, I had to cut a lot of content and the example application was one of the items to be cut. But I still have the source for those applications so I'm posting it here today.

Below is the example built using the Swiz application framework. Another four posts will contain the other four versions. All five versions have identical functionality. Right click on the swf to view the source. <a href="/blog/flex-mvc/flexcaster-swiz.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
