<p>I was already considering making the trip to San Jose to attend the 360|Flex conference this March when the organisers asked me if I'd present a session. 360|Flex has interested me for some time. It's the most technical, developer oriented of the many Flash and Flex conferences around, and as a developer myself that obviously interests me. The level of technical knowledge amongst the speakers is immense.
But 360|Flex is about more than just technical presentations. John and Tom try very hard to make this a conference where all attendees feel part of a community. <a href="/blog/conferences/360flex-san-jose.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>In yesterday's post, I mentioned that unit tests should test the interface and not the implementation. This is the simplest example I could think of to demonstrate this. <a href="/blog/tdd/test-the-interface-not-the-implementation.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2010-02-04T12:00:00Z">04 February 2010</time></div>

<p>At work today, a colleague and I did a presentation to the rest of the team on Test Driven Development. At BrightTALK we've been using unit tests for some of our code for a few months now, but it's been very much a case of writing tests after writing the code. Often, it's just after (write the code, then write the test) but still, the code came first. A couple of months ago I persuaded the Flash/Flex team to try writing the tests first. They found it difficult for the first few days, but rapidly got up to speed and are now very enthusiastic about writing tests first. So we hosted this presentation/discussion with the whole team, Actionscript, PHP and Java developers, to discuss Test Driven Development. One thing I really wanted to convey to them were the benefits of writing the test first. These are the five main benefits as I see them. <a href="/blog/tdd/why-write-the-unittest-first.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<h2><a href="/blog/general/the-ipad-is-not-a-computer.html">The iPad is not a computer</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2010-01-30T12:00:00Z">30 January 2010</time></div>

<p>I waited a few days before writing about the iPad. Apple product launches tend to contain some surprises and I wanted a little time for reflection before commenting.

My considered opinion: the iPad is a revolutionary device, because it's not a computer. The iPad isn't for writing, it's for reading. It's not for making films, its for watching films. It's not for developing software, it's for using software. The iPad is a consumer device. What makes the iPad revolutionary is its single-minded focus on media consumption. <a href="/blog/general/the-ipad-is-not-a-computer.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2009-12-17T12:00:00Z">17 December 2009</time></div>

<p>A number of Flint users have written on-line tutorials recently and I've added those I'm aware of to the documentation page. There's now many more ways to learn about how to use Flint, particularly at the beginner level. If there's more tutorials out there that I've missed, let me know via the forum. <a href="/flint-particles/blog/many-additions-to-the-documentation.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>During my recent presentation at LFPUG, Tink was very persistent in suggesting that the event bus used in most MVC frameworks might not be the best solution. This got me thinking about what it would be like to do MVC without an event bus. And so began this little experiment. <a href="/blog/flex-mvc/flexcaster-smartysignals.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
