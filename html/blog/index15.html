<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-08-15T12:00:00Z">15 August 2007</time></div>

<p>Actionscript 3 seems to have two different types of weak references. The difference relates to method closures (or bound methods) and the weak references used by the EventDispatcher and Dictionary classes. Try the following. <a href="/blog/actionscript/different-types-of-weak-references.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-08-14T12:00:00Z">14 August 2007</time></div>

<p>I documented my technique for implementing event dispatching over on the Flash Game Code site. I've been using this method for a couple of years now and I think it's a lot better than EventDispatcher or ASBroadcaster. Take a look if your interested. Comments are welcome below.

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-07-27T12:00:00Z">27 July 2007</time></div>

<p>I've mentioned before how I dislike the Singleton pattern. So this morning I was experimenting with various other possible ways to create singletons in Actionscript 3 and came up with a function that can be used to create and reuse a single instance of any class. I don't know how useful it will turn out to be but here it is. It's also a useful example of a package level function. <a href="/blog/actionscript/singleton-factory.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-07-10T12:00:00Z">10 July 2007</time></div>

<p>At the weekend I wrote a couple of JSFL scripts to automate SWFEncrypt and SWCEncrypt encryption from within Flash.

The first publishes the current flash movie and encrypts the resulting .swf using SWFEncrypt. The second exports one or more components as SWC files and encrypts the results using SWCEncrypt. <a href="/blog/flash/swfencrypt-from-flash-using-jsfl.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>After the LFPUG meeting where I did my Physics for Flash Games presentation I was chatting to a few people and realised they have a lot of assumptions about training courses, most particularly about the environment and style of training. I've taught at a few different training companies and like to categorise training courses into three distinct styles. Which is right for you? <a href="/blog/training/theres-training-and-then-theres-training.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-05-14T12:00:00Z">14 May 2007</time></div>

<p>It happened recently that I needed to load a list of items from a text file. There was no other structure to the file except that each item in the list was on a separate line. The items were not in XML and they were not in form variables format (used by LoadVars). Here's how it's done. <a href="/blog/actionscript/list-loader-for-actionscript-2.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-04-27T12:00:00Z">27 April 2007</time></div>

<p>Until recently I wasn't sure if casual multiplayer gaming was possible. In my experience, multiplayer gaming required a serious investment of time and energy.

But I spent most of yesterday afternoon playing Zwok, a multiplayer game that is so simple, and so much fun, I figure there may be something to learn from it. (And if I do learn from it I won't have to write off yesterday afternoon as wasted time). So here's a brief summary of my thoughts so far.

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-04-18T12:00:00Z">18 April 2007</time></div>

<p>I get asked about this often in my training courses so I thought it might be good to air the issue here. I'm not the first to post about this online but for some reason many people aren't finding the solution so here it is.
How to show DHTML content (e.g. a pull-down menu) on top of flash content?.
