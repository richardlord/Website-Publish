<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2011-11-14T12:00:00Z">14 November 2011</time></div>

<p>It has been an interesting week in the Flash world. Various announcements and clarifications about the future of Flash, which seem to add up to


Adobe will stop development of the Flash mobile browser plug-in, but mobile operating system and hardware developers are free to continue developing on top of Adobe's existing source code if they wish to license it from Adobe.
The Flex framework will be freed from Adobe's control, and will become more open under the guidance of an as yet undecided open source foundation which will include Adobe contributors and the Spoon project.
Development of the Flash plug-in for desktop browsers continues as normal.
Development of Adobe Air, including publishing for mobile apps, continues as normal.
There's renewed emphasis on the Flash platform as a platform for game development.
There has been some movement of jobs on the Flash CS Professional team, but the team still exists and the next version of the product is in development.


There's been a lot of hand-wringing as Flash developers struggle to figure out what this means for them. I don't propose to resolve that here - what this means for you depends on both your skill-set and your job. But I guess if I had one bit of advice it would be, if Actionscript is the only development language you know it's well past time for you to diversify your skills. Learning a second programming language makes you a better programmer in general, and learning a third, fourth, etc becomes easier with each language. I have lost track of the number of programming languages I have learnt, but each one has made me a better programmer.

What follows is merely my personal take on the situation. Make of it what you will. I'll start with an important question. <a href="so-what-are-adobe-up-to-with-flash.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<h2><a href="swfencrypt-from-flash-using-jsfl.html">SWFEncrypt from Flash using JSFL</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-07-10T12:00:00Z">10 July 2007</time></div>

<p>At the weekend I wrote a couple of JSFL scripts to automate SWFEncrypt and SWCEncrypt encryption from within Flash.

The first publishes the current flash movie and encrypts the resulting .swf using SWFEncrypt. The second exports one or more components as SWC files and encrypts the results using SWCEncrypt. <a href="swfencrypt-from-flash-using-jsfl.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-04-18T12:00:00Z">18 April 2007</time></div>

<p>I get asked about this often in my training courses so I thought it might be good to air the issue here. I'm not the first to post about this online but for some reason many people aren't finding the solution so here it is.
How to show DHTML content (e.g. a pull-down menu) on top of flash content?.

<h2><a href="protecting-a-swf.html">Protecting a swf</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-03-21T12:00:00Z">21 March 2007</time></div>

<p>In my training courses I often get asked about protecting swf movies. There's two sides to this - one is encrypting the code to make it hard for others to decompile and use, and the other is limiting where the swf can be used from so that users can't simply place your swf on their website.

There are a number of commercial and free obfuscating and encryption tools to help protect your code so I'm not going to say any more about them (maybe in a later post). Here's a few ideas for how to limit where the swf movie may be used.

<h2><a href="free-flash-preloader-components.html">Free flash preloader components</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2007-03-07T12:00:00Z">07 March 2007</time></div>

<p>Some time ago I created a set of components for creating preloaders. They are designed so that the graphics, style and text feedback can all be modified by the user without writing any code.

I used to charge a small fee for them but they're getting a bit long in the tooth now. Since updating them doesn't fit with my current plans I'm making them available for free so please help yourself. <a href="free-flash-preloader-components.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<p>I was very pleased that Strictly Sudoku was Adobe's Site of the Day last Friday.
In creating the site, the aim was to make the best sudoku site on the web and this
award suggests we have gone some way towards that. What follows is a description of how I implemented the custom context menu and keyboard shortcuts on that site. <a href="custom-context-menu-with-keyboard-shortcuts-in-flash.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p><hr />

<h2><a href="flash-player-full-screen.html">Flash player update adds full-screen support</a></h2>
<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2006-10-13T12:00:00Z">13 October 2006</time></div>

<p>Adobe have released a beta update for the flash player on Adobe Labs. Among the new features are support for a full-screen mode on the web, so it won't be long now before we have full-screen flash video and other content on web sites. A brief summary of using full-screen mode in Actionscript 2 follows. <a href="flash-player-full-screen.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
