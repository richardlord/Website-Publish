<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2016-09-12T12:00:00Z">12 September 2016</time></div>

<p>Working on a long project is hard. I’ve been working on and off on Intergalactic Delivery Driver for ten months now. There were some gaps in that time, particularly the three months I spent working at King when I got almost nothing done on the game. <a href="/intergalactic-delivery-driver/blog/taking-a-break.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>Most of us trust most of our friends. We trust them not to cheat and lie to us for their own gain. We trust them not to steal from us or to assault us. But how about strangers? Not a specific stranger but strangers in general. Do you trust them? Do you trust the other people in your country not to cheat, lie, steal, and assault others for their own gain? Maybe you think like me that most people are okay but there’s a few bad apples. Or maybe not. Maybe there’s a group of people you particularly don’t trust. <a href="/blog/general/most-people-are-good-people.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2016-05-18T12:00:00Z">18 May 2016</time></div>

<p>Last week was an interesting week for Intergalactic Delivery Driver, the game I'm currently developing. The week started with a crisis in confidence as I debated whether the meta-game would work and ended with a number of changes and much greater confidence in the quality of the game in general and the meta-game in particular. <a href="/intergalactic-delivery-driver/blog/refactoring-the-meta-game-in-intergalactic-delivery-driver.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2016-03-31T12:00:00Z">31 March 2016</time></div>

<p>The brilliant Critical Distance have proposed "Choreography" as the topic for their March collection of Blogs of the Round Table and I think, as a choreographer turned game developer, I should have something to say on this. I pondered what to write and eventually decided to write about just one game, the wonderful Monument Valley by ustwo. <a href="/blog/game-design/the-choreography-of-monument-valley.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-11-03T12:00:00Z">03 November 2015</time></div>

<p>This is a short editor script that I use for creating instances of ScriptableObject classes in the Unity editor. Most scripts that create ScriptableObjects require you to add new code for each object type. This script does not. Select any class that extends ScriptableObject and choose Create->Instance to create an instance of that class. <a href="/blog/unity/creating-scriptableobjects-in-unity.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-10-22T12:00:00Z">22 October 2015</time></div>

<p>Many developers come to Unity from a background in object-oriented programming and look to use the same patterns in Unity that they used elsewhere. You don't neglect what you have learnt elsewhere just because you are using a different tool but sometimes you have to apply those lessons differently with the new tool. Unity has its own idea about how you should architect a game and before you start fighting against this it is best to try working with it - you will be a lot more productive if you do. <a href="/blog/unity/inversion-of-control-in-unity.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-09-24T12:00:00Z">24 September 2015</time></div>

<p>You may be surprised if I tell you that Freak Factory is about life, but it is.

Every time you play Freak Factory you lose, eventually. You may prolong the game, you may get a high score, but eventually you will lose. Losing is inevitable and every Freak you make reduces the space you have, reduces how much game you have left. While you play it the game doesn't get harder, it gets less. With every move you make you see the end approaching. <a href="/freak-factory/blog/why-freak-factory.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-06-26T12:00:00Z">26 June 2015</time></div>

<p>This blog post was originally published on the Develop:Brighton website on 26 June 2015.

I remember as a choreographer at dance school showing my choreography teacher my first dance piece. I'd spent a term making this dance, working with three dancers who were studying with me. This was extra-curricular activity but I wanted to make this dance and I felt good about it. So, in search of praise I asked my choreography teacher, Ingegerd Lonnroth, to look at it. <a href="/blog/choreography-games/seeing-whats-really-there.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
