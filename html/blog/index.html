<p>There are many different solutions to managing finite state machines in Unity. I donâ€™t intend to comment here on the goodness of any other solutions - the best solution is the one that works for you. I just want to tell you about how I manage state machines. If you find it useful please go ahead and copy me and if you have any suggestions for how to improve on this technique please tell me. <a href="/blog/unity/finite-state-machines-in-unity.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>This is a short editor script that I use for creating instances of ScriptableObject classes in the Unity editor. Most scripts that create ScriptableObjects require you to add new code for each object type. This script does not. Select any class that extends ScriptableObject and choose Create->Instance to create an instance of that class. <a href="/blog/unity/creating-scriptableobjects-in-unity.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<p>Many developers come to Unity from a background in object-oriented programming and look to use the same patterns in Unity that they used elsewhere. You don't neglect what you have learnt elsewhere just because you are using a different tool but sometimes you have to apply those lessons differently with the new tool. Unity has its own idea about how you should architect a game and before you start fighting against this it is best to try working with it - you will be a lot more productive if you do. <a href="/blog/unity/inversion-of-control-in-unity.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-09-24T12:00:00Z">24 September 2015</time></div>

<p>You may be surprised if I tell you that Freak Factory is about life, but it is.

Every time you play Freak Factory you lose, eventually. You may prolong the game, you may get a high score, but eventually you will lose. Losing is inevitable and every Freak you make reduces the space you have, reduces how much game you have left. While you play it the game doesn't get harder, it gets less. With every move you make you see the end approaching. <a href="/freak-factory/blog/why-freak-factory.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-07-22T12:00:00Z">22 July 2015</time></div>

<p>In this session at the Develop conference in Brighton I presented seven important lessons that I learnt as a choreographer that are still important to me as a game designer. I accompanied each lesson with the story of how I learnt it and an example of how it might apply in game design. <a href="/blog/presentations/choreographer-game-designer.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-06-26T12:00:00Z">26 June 2015</time></div>

<p>This blog post was originally published on the Develop:Brighton website on 26 June 2015.

I remember as a choreographer at dance school showing my choreography teacher my first dance piece. I'd spent a term making this dance, working with three dancers who were studying with me. This was extra-curricular activity but I wanted to make this dance and I felt good about it. So, in search of praise I asked my choreography teacher, Ingegerd Lonnroth, to look at it. <a href="/blog/choreography-games/seeing-whats-really-there.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-06-17T12:00:00Z">17 June 2015</time></div>

<p>This blog post was originally published on Gamasutra on 17 June 2015.

Before I became a game developer I was an independent contemporary dance choreographer with my own dance company. And in my 14 years creating dances, and a further 14 creating games, I've experienced all sorts of collaborations. For me, there are three key ingredients to a good collaboration. <a href="/blog/choreography-games/what-makes-a-good-collaboration.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>

<div id="meta">Posted on <time datetime="2015-06-10T12:00:00Z">10 June 2015</time></div>

<p>I've been heads down building stuff for Bubble Pack for a while now, which is why I haven't talked about it much. A lot of news has built up.

A New Name

The game now has its final name and art style. The name is Freak Factory. What were bubbles are now little critters called Freaks, and what was a simple box is now a factory in which you make these Freaks. And if you don't keep them contained they will escape and the game ends. Trust me, it all makes sense and looks wonderful. <a href="/freak-factory/blog/bubble-pack-becomes-freak-factory.html">Continue reading &rarr;</a></p>
